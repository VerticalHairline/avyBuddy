I was building an app that I have wanted to for a long time, so I figured I would put it up on Github.

Feel free to make fun of me for my awful code or whatever, its my first project so the criticism is appreciated.

Here is the idea: users can upload routes that they normally take in the backcountry, and then when the day comes that they go use
that route they can use this web application to see how dangerous it is based on avalanche center apis (Just utah right now). They
will also be able to see a list of all the routes they have saved and can see which ones are the safest. That is the current working idea, may change in the future

NOTE:
this is now outdated, the new repsoitory for this project is here:
github.com/VerticalHairline/avyBuddy-web
